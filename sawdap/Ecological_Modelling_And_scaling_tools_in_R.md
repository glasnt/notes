scaling data from leaf -> site -> continent

5 x 5km area, continent wide maps, for 30 years or by month
 - temp - solar, wet/rainfall -> 3 inputs -> 0 output types

Original in FORTRAN77, 20 year ago 
 - no comments, original developer passed away
 - 2 minute compile time in fortran -> a day in the R port
 => model in C++, interface in R
  - armadillo
  - object orientated
  - ++ usability by domain users
  - ++ statistical library
  - CC sharealike 2.0 licence


leads to globa climate models 
 - requires ++preprocessing

geoscience community use python

15 hour magic - can I run it overnight?

currently "monthly", daily would be nice

netcdf - data structure   of source data .xcdf files

@rhyswhitley - will buy beer and/or paper attributions for fixes
