Data is code, Code is Data

Ekert & Monchly - ENAIC computers

Church: "Everything is code" 
Turing: "Everything is dad"

Relations have underlying meaning
 - (not databases (RDBS), can't store what we need

                   Representation   Meaning
    Church Code         ./            ./
    Turing Data         ./            ./
    Relational Data     ./            ./
     Other              ./            ?
     - graphs, documents, streams

Hetrogenerous Data - semi structured data 
 -> data dredging

See data how we see code

"Sintella Project" - web interaction

Example - stream of two users
 - hovering, clicking & GET of a web page 

    \ GET    hover             click          }
       (o)  -------  ( ++ )  --------- ( = )  }  hover counter machine
    / click            ^_| hover              }


Turing machine - the general computing machine 
  -> data is     the general programming language

 - we create domain specific machines which gives meaning to the data

Comments 
 - rule mining (from data mining)
 - "finite state machine" is restrictive; make it *abstract*
 - infered machines
 - labbel transitions
