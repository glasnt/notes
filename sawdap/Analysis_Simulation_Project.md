Could compate the public vs plice constables

Current process

Ideal process
 - organised data -> researchers, users -> publications

User != participants - descriptive, sequence

Ethics Committee, A/B Testing

Researchers currently doing manual excel dumps & analysis on file dumps

Researchers - all data
Users - averages + own results

Other visualizations
 - heat maps (limited to 3 colours because excel limitations and conditional formatting rules
 - better dynamic visualizations would have to be automated


-------



Comments
 - discussion of users defining the visualizations with evolution, rather than static solution
 - heat map implementation - colouring simple, getting data out, averages, hop nmber, cell specific next hop
