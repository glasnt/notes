## On the Importance of Upstreaming
### Robin Sheat

* uber customization prevents upgrade paths
* giving back to the project
* collaboration between users and devs
* Vanity
* downside - added time for politics, interference with other usecases

For Projects
 - use public issue tracker and reply to input
 - for larger projects - create coding guidelines
  - documentation
  - assistance for new comers & fix issues and common concerns
  - accept "noob" patches, but then correct them afterwards and show the feedback
