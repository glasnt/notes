* Haskwell GovHack - Brispark
* geoip sub element location data for praks
* cassava csv parse
* postgres import vis postresql-simple (realish SQL emded within haskell)
* Snap - scaffolding does exist
* Heist - load time errors, not compile time
* was going to be using PureScript, but not a thing to learn during a hack
* ended up using raw javascript
* in haskell, if it compiles at 3am, it's OK
* database types safe, pref used "persistant"
* Snap doesn't use WAI
* Warp faster than nginx
* Yesod uses compile time checking
* github.com/silkapp/rest - just a rest 
* FP Complete has application server hosting
* is.gd/CNx0na - haskell app hosting lightning talk
* UX is important
