* Zigbee - Power Sustainabiliyt (Smart Home, with Linux)
* RAVEn - Python Daemon
* Smart Reader to Power Company
* Allows up to 30s to real time power usage
* Temp, Humidity, etc sensors
* Smart meters in VIC, NSW?
* Temp readings are slower than real time
* cat virtual file system for statistics
* Power: 1wH, 10wH
* Water: 0.5L, 5L
* Did not use RaspPi because it has no internal clock, relied on NTP/Network exclusively
* NUC Fedora, more reliable OS for micro-pc
* OpenHAB - Home Automation Bus (Java, OSGI)
* Uses feed from BOM to compare to home local readings
* Power consumption per device or grouping
* Sensor cost outlay pays for self eventually (captial on solar +++)
* Hot water use - est wake-up times
* Needs to be locked down hard (SSL + P/W) due to home attendance/noone home
* View to making human-actionable hot water boost app on Pebble (either wait for heat from solar, or boost if required)
* Methane leaking from Gas Pipes has high global warming effect
* Uses no gas, because Coal Seam Gas (Fracking) Bad
