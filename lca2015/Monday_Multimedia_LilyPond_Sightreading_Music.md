* repeating music -> muscle memory, repetition, not reading
* pattern recognision
* imslp.org - online music scoes
* sav.net.au/sight-reading
 * tablet capable

Lilypond 
 * text-based score engraving

Frescobaldi

Sorting A-Z on notes doesn't work, because B2 comes before C3

App generates scales based on steps, for all permutations 
 -> generated a C# minor, with 3 double-flats in the keysignature (outputted key sign looked cool, but scary)

Future: 
 * meta language
 * instrument profiles (e.g. x uses base, as range y to z)
