Maintainability over features - selection bias

git used like svn - always rebase

only way to play DVDs

VLC actually a 200 line wrapper for libVLC

use best code base for plaform -> v. modular (android, ipod, etc)

Core = light, OS abstrction memory network, sync audio/video

libVLCcore - master is always broken

120K LOC core
700k LOC modules
80 external modules

Module probing for subtype: 
 - demux (opener)
 - access
 - filter
 - codex
-> caching

libVLC = FULL(!) media framework
