BDale, Tridge, Linus + Rusty -> repeat panel from 12 years ago
 - audio available

Freedombox 0.3 released night before panel

throw-away key signing

"I refuse to change... that sounds bad.." - Linux

LKML hate - systemd(?)

vocal minority doesnt and shouldnt speak for all

not everyone has to be a kernel developer

real world feedback loops - LEDs, servos
 - get kids interested in tech

systemd - unsure what all the fuss is about

opensource - let you guts to all the work - coasting, then stress at merge

memory ephemeral -  disk will always be required

scaling will stop 

always the year of the desktop

10 years til 5nm chipsets -> quantum(?)

Hardware will change more than the software 

Biological systems 

hacking how to 

documentation not always the answer

current desktops: 
 - tridge - emacs + trusty, or gnu-screen
 - bdale - debian unstable
 - linus - fedora 21 + text editor (not gnome, vi, emacs; obscure one)
 - rusty - arch, ubuntu

userped by a computer? - as long as it runs free software

mechanisation of software development ++ - at least in PR chat

buln. research focus - bitcoin rusty
 - disclouse responsibly, but short time frame

us vs world -> much more open, git more than the kernel
