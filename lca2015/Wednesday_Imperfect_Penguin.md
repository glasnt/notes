World Domination - the day of the tentacle, with the penguin

CVE - international - CVE-YYYY-NNNN (len(N) = 4, but now 5-7)

we expect more than 10,000 vul.ns in a year

Heartbleed - no trace, all kernel


CUSS - IO = bad, 

heartbleed ~5.6 misrepresented
 - private key refresh, possibly on still compromised software?
 - not properly communicated
 - not just webservers, all SSL servers and client
 - still present in Android 4.1.1.

Heartbleed has 7 sibiling CVSs

Shellshock - worse than heartbleed, but left log traces

NTPd 19-dec-2014
 - vectors: remote code execution, denial of service
 - exploits available
 - recommendation - abandon

ESB bulletin from Auscert - 2500+ bulletins in 2014

Super Vul.s
 - significant input
 - reliable explote
 - ubiquitous install base
 - (not drupal)

White hats - more activity since snowden


largest group -> sharpest point on the triangle 
Activists (script kiddies) -> Organised Crime (money making, usually quiet) -> Nation State (Five Eyes)

Sony vs North Korea - US is hush hush, but probably was NK.

Bad things - 
 - modern routers are 80% vul. off shelf, pre shellshoc, heartbleed
 - abandoned versions of android, e.g. 4.3. No more google patches
 - firmware
 - Internet Of things - embedded security might help

DevCon found 5 ero-days on modems

Best MitM = Modem , e.g. kana, TheMoon

Home energry monitoring - proxy information transfer to China

SystemD wedge

HOW to fix a found vuln: 
 - keep quiet initially
 - request CVE ID (usually issued within a day)
 - write report
 - fix and publish release
 - ONLY THEN announce publically

pakage manager w/signing and validation

SOHO network devices - CeroWRT, openhomegateway, ORPI

pip is unsigned, MitM vuln. 

code reviews, bounties, lead by exmaple

Core Infrastructure Initiative 
 - supported by qualcomm, huawai, microsoft.. 
 - also google, facebook, NEC, HP
 - funding to fix the 2014 Big 3

Linux Foundation 
 - annual FOSS code review
 - adhoc review on request

a self-made zombie apocolypse would be bad

logisitcs of consumer patching

security by default

embedded devs dont grok security - but add network points
 - cake wrecks? Embeded wrecks (Gerret Talk has more examples)
