- 40 minute rant incoming

desktops -> mainframes

rest of the world - watches, wearables

phones are transitional -> happens to make calls, is a computer

Tesla Rest API -> webserver, mobile, accelerates well

humans are still in control

objects dont talk to one another - batters are hard enough

most IoT are remote controls

TV Remote pile is now a ipad full of apps

* someone is wrong on the internet *

more buttons, worse design - offloading decisions to the user

Sony Remote = Full querty keyboard; Apple TV - small, just as functional

should be making less friction

the smarts are in the lightbulb - turning it off at the wall switch breaks it

workflow for smart vs old light

jasper rasperry pi - voice control

smart washing machine = $1700 x 2 (for dryer as well)

smart should work it all out
 - on off button, nfc tags for clothes

magic, not "smart" - anticipation, not reaction

standard wars - if doing it now, they are selling you something

network connectivity != the internet

client neutral - your IoT thing is not special - cross compatable with duct tape

API Cloud only = bad
 - local apis are under documented

OWI intutiion - mail for manual

cross IoT application made by speaker

CO2 notification? weekly push notifications
 - bad, bad, bad! health issue, people!
 - should be able to get aircon to vent room on co2 builup
 - shouldn't have to be object specific or custom code'

Autodiscovery - noral people see IP/MAC addr hard

IFTTT - cloud based
 - when devices 6 feet apart, IoT should be local!

***PRIVACY***

boiler explosion via IoT - when will the first murder happen?

carna botnet - embedded devices - internet concensus 2012.. "research"

internet radio in hotel post revamp
 - app powered.. all of them in hotel 
 - enabled on checkin (cool, but how bad was the hack? perl?)
 - fleet of consumer devices
 - some factory reset - pin == 1234
 - potential harm - 4am rock music (just think of the tripadvisor comments)
 - should have been industrial fleet, but consumer was probably cheaper
 - scaling problem

encrypted proxy - 3 layer solution

IoT discovery protocol - middle abstracted d. model - reverse client

lighting models are complicated

thethingsystem.com - ideas, nodejs, middleware

local installation, rules engine. Currently "toolfairy" release

json over UDP or websockets - end to end encrypton

Things as a Service - TaaS

First law of robotics in IoT

(link xkcd "simple answers" strip

not killing people is a very worthy aim
 - i can still bludgen you with a laptop

want choice, ability to customise or make automatic
