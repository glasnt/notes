(All opinions from panelists, attributions where possible)

Tech in 5-years time - linux kernel

lxc, docker, coreos, opend2 - all containers

docker will lose - Steve0

A standard for containers? No (RH) Yes (Ub.)

Backporting Bad

Rhel7

swagger - client updates to API, go python, etc

CGroup - nonallocation should be a thing

VM replace w/container -. holy grail

Learning curve - host container easy; moving a container harder

Dependency on Kernel is OK - standards are stable

lxc container vs aother container

Zones in BSD - prepare container format

History 
 - debian/redhat -  you don't need a custom OS. 
 - vmware - you don't need your own box
 - containers - you don't need your own vm

 VMware is in trouble

Package based distros - e.g. ssh binary issues -> human signature?

Openused used to blat on package over all versions -> now harder to update w/docker

server security > phone security, but app stores

No hash revocation mechanisms in containers 

Software defined network
Everyone has their own IP
 - why not both?

Microsoft containers (?)
