talk = rant /flamewar

flamewars = CFP fodder

Any monkey can program

Dunner/Kruger effect

noob -> expert -> apprentice -> master -> guru

LKML - linux kernel mailing list
 - 'I want to fix the FIXME fixes' 
 - given ++advice, ignored
 - no improvement in output

unknown programmers effect group productivity in any undetaking

Lesson #1 - to become competent, the ability to learn is of primary importance

Trunk learning, then leaves

head => index of where to find information, learn
 - "I got all of google"

C-scope

- intellectuallyy managble programs - Dikjstra

humans cannot program

Dikjstra - "The humble programmer"

we cannot prove our code is bug free

Sel4 (lca2015 talk - 10K LOC, +10 year proof -> "bug free" (quotation marks)

Math pool for formal proofs of code ~= 1000 people total globally
 - dont hold your breath

a group of people are not a good program...ers

we dont program to fix bad code

Lesson #2 - if you cant understand design of the code, you arent cpable of proving that the coe is fit for purpose

"You can't trust code you didn't totally create yourself" - Ken Thompson

Lesson #3 - Human program capacity doesnt scale in a trusted manner beyond one brain

Lesson #4 - programming is not available metho of developing method of software project

guru laer as up to the top *speaker points at linus*

guru meditation

knowledge transfer - critical communication

documentation/memory-barriers.txt - nightmare fuel

Moe than one guru

if guru can't grok, there's a failure in the process

with no knowledge transfer, knowledge is lost

single brain insufficient

"thought review" - more than just code

patch not done til people can read it without having to ask more questions - Andrew Mrton

git blame - .. oh! commit messages!

context, process, who what when where why 

scope of fix => cause and effect (knock-on issues)

Design - Break - Build - Repeat

we cannot reach perfection
