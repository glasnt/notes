25x more harrassment for female
 - tested,proven with two identical IRC bots, with different gendered names

Toxic system defaults

blind orchestra auditions - 5% -> 40% female musicians over 5 years

5 experiments to level up as humans: 
 - change speech defaults - idioms that are ablist, biased, etc, are no good
 - listen to people not like you - listen != RT, that's a conversation
 - change online persona
  - Viki Kendal - experiment to change persona from female of colour to male - much changes
  - some males changed to female of colour - opted out within 2 hours of harrassment
 - speak up for others 
  - suggestions from others? reinforce their idea, don't rehash as your own w/out attrib.
 - Ask for help and accept it humbly. 

Active listening - mirroring

Assuming makes an ass out of you and me - ask questions, make fewer assumptions

Measure own actions - how often do you: 
 - have the floor
 - interrupt others
 - dismissive of others

Implicit assocications test > Hardward

neurologically atypical - make explicit rules for interactions
