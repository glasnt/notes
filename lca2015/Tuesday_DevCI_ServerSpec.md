- rspec-based software installation testing

testing servers and installations - rspec, vagrant, local

ownership testing - `.owned_by? "flapjack"`

Automate QA, scalable

better than cucumber

fail early, fail often

can prove that it "works on my machine and yours" - local vagrant install vs vagrant fleet server deployment

capybara!

dev tools: package install - check, desc commands, file hash, install process

Sysadmin tools: after puppet, file symlink, dir, gorups, users, file systems, php settings, network

Windows resource types: iis app pool! executable versions, registry testing

flapjack.io - filteres for nagios notifications

`describe (), if () { } ` - rspec optional test - essential for cross-OS testing

regex comments in a file? symantic differences - e.g. commented out lines. 
 - puppet might have some logic for this?
