Crypto isn't broken, it's bypassed

lots of real work "how it was hacked" examples given - mtorolla, cameras, samsung

Android Code signing - APK = Jar = ZIP
 - duplicate files in zip handled differently in java vs C, attack vector

HSM - 'tamper proof' hardware
 - gives a yes-no result only
 - can be mitigated by using custom decimilzation table, pin offset -> mastermind style guess checking

NSA Backdoors ++
 - catalogs of how tos in leaked documents, many many slides worth
 - built in gag orders

Some providers forced to shutdown rather than fight, e.g. lavabit

SP 800-90
 - some very bad crypto, but a lot do (multiple slides of why)

handshake inspection -> leaked information

NIST standard known to be bad 
 - NSA knew, easier to hack

RSA warns not to use RSA
 - sponsor-described deliverable
 - appears to work, but provable not to be
 - back door operator

ECC - seeded by NSA
 - one is "magic" by being fixed (in the gambling sense)

One just has to hope the pi isn't backdoored

new non-NSA ECC curves 
 - source: digits of pi
 - -> 12-24 hour adoption by opensource

1945 manual on sabotage techniques
 - multiple slides
 - sounds like the mode of operations for most companies

Crypto shouldn't be decided by a commiette

Named programs that bypass sisco, juniper

Hauwai Routers - US deems them "unsafe", but US routers are known vuln. 

Booby-trapping routes in transit -> going to cloud

Geographic entitlement

Crypto != soysauce for security

Attack around the edges of where crypto is found
