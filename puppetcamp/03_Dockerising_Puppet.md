## Dockerising Puppet

by manageacloud

 - example - docker + puppet + wordpress
 
 - creation, orchestration
  
 - node classification 
  - based on cert created at buildtime, with role name and 3-character random string (unique)
  - allows for unique, role based nodes
  - never explicitly named
  - pets vs cattle

 - github.com/garethr/docker
  - create a local docker repository

 - example of fat container vs slim containers 
  - docker has some smarts, but puppet can be leveraged as well
