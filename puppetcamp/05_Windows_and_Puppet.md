## Windows and Puppet

(User talk, not Puppet Labs)

 - is puppet ready for Windows? No

 - Powershell wrapped in ruby

 - puppet is the delivery system 
  - ruby compiled code on server
  - ruby on windows is not as good as on linux

 - TechNet scripts 
  - convert to puppet, ruby, should then go onto the Forge

 - Good in powershell, best in puppet

 - `.ps1.erb` files. 

 - provider -> `powershell`

 - not an ACID setup, cant always be trusted

 - One command, different results

 - Puppet can't see system configurations
  - can't enforce standards
  - puppet user limitations
  - registry - machine branch and current user only
  - can't affect logged in users

 
 - standalone instance creation
  - puppet best in market

 - Write once, run forever * 

 - Openstack Puppet Master -> windows creation

 - require `win_setup`, 2k LOC instructions, 6 minutes 'bake' time

 - puppet as a delivery system

 - chocolatey - original developer hired by puppetlabls

 - Windows asynchronous. Will happen.. eventually
