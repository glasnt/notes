## Puppet Enterprise Demo

 - MCollective Web UI pulled in 3.8 due to performance
  - still available via CLI
 
 - Statuses
  - No-op = testing mode
  - Unreported = first puppet run not yet done

 - Custom facts

 - AD Group link permissions

 - "enough rope" for developers
 
 - vagrant has regex based ssh

 - Event driven logs

 - out of sync - state before changed

 - JVM rewrite allows for introspection

 - Puppet directly uses MS tools 
  - wmic, dcim, etc
  - nuget visual studio own server -> equiv to local package manager

 - "Click this and next and next and dont read this bit and next" 
  -- installing IIS on windows

 - demo installed firefox, notepad++, git, dotnet for Windows 2008R2

 - jenkins 1.5 is pretty
  - demo showed upgrade from 1.44 to 1.5 in seconds

 - event inspection
  - orup by class, node, resource
  - allows for debugging of source of the bug

 - puppet supported forge modules for windows
 
 - rebooting on windows supported via pending reboot flag
  - doesn't report as down during reboot
  - picks up where it left off

 - puppet now top down, but does observe dependencies

 - puppet/environments/x 
  - vs separate puppet environment as a branch

 - puppetDB is HA

 - we are not VMware's puppet 
  - received funding, but not in their hand

 - mcollective useful in a workflow for quick patching, e.g. shellshock
