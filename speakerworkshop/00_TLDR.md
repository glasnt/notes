| You are the post powerful person in the room. Do what you like, as long as it's good.


 - Don't distract your audience 
  - wear dark clothes, no words on your shirt. Focus then falls on your hands, arms and face
  - remove items, where possible. Clocks near projector screens are a disaster

 - Get a clicker
  - get one with a dongle and dedicated channel. 
  - you cannot rely on the internet working, or a directional clicker

 - There is nothing wrong with showing emotion
  - communication happens at a emotional and intellectual level
  - removing emotion cuts off communication

 - Slides tips
  - smallest font should be ~60pt, fifth of screen height 
  - negative space is your friend
  - leave 10% margin on edges

 - Posture tips
  - feet facing the audience, perhaps with one foot slightly forward
  - hands should never touch body
  - palms should face outward, and be inviting

 - Presenter presentation
  - makeup is ok, if it makes you comfortable and confident (also helpful if talk is recorded)
  - hair - up is very formal, but just don't touch it during
