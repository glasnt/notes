## Talk - Slideless presentation

## Feedback

 - You can be emotive without emotions
 
 - no visuals can be a break

 - anecdotal story and testimony are good

 - personal stories are the hardest

 - opening up is compelling

 - talk could be used as a 5-minute softer introduction into a technical talk
 
 - don't fill the void
  - you don't have to inject noise into your open carrier channel

 - Not everyone knows what you know, even if you are young

 - strong solid stance is commanding

 - Like learning to drive
  - concentrating on many things at once, but forgetting the journey afterwards
  - think and speak and notice the subtlites
