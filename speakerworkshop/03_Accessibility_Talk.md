 * 'standard' page layouts are horrible for screenreaders. use landmarks

 * WAI ARIA Roles
  - most are assumed in html5, but some are required to be denoted)

 * little X in a popup window on mobile devices = hard
  - even harder for disabled people

  - selector tab index attribute

### Feedback

 - Don't read notes from laptop 
 - if using a browser, fullscreen the slides
 - if describing examples, use onscreen visuals where possible
  - e.g. show a representation of how a screen would appear to a person with xyz impairment

 - leaning to click arrow for slide advancement = distractor
  - use clicker

 - Clicker advice
  - don't use an app - relies on wifi
  - don't use IR one - relies on direction
  - use a wireless one with a USB dongle and dedicated channel
  - disable the laser pointer - remove it or cover it

 - Eye contact with the audience
  - look at forehead or just to the left
  
 - Position of hands 
  - don't put hands on sides
  - don't touch yourself
  - free, expressive movement, palms forward

 - Dress - Neckline 
  - distracting if too low (understandable)
  - audience should focus on your message, not you
  

 - Projectors are crap
  - whitewash, jpeg artefacts are highlighted
  
 - Transition or phase in high content slides
 
 - Voice
  - deeper is better, but no James Earl Jones
  - quivering voice assumes nerves, lack of control
  - flustered can lead to squeaking

 - Emotive works, e.g. "daunting"
 
 - Do not say sorry
  - do not apologise
  - don't draw attention to any small mistakes

 - Stance - one foot ahead, slightly leaning forward
  - don't rock (reassuring self gesture)
  - you can walk at a stroll, but don't strafe

 - Humour - dependant on crowd
  - good example: IE6 humour/references

 - Slow down speaking
  - if you'll go over time, cut material. 

 - Speaker ticks
  - saying 'um', ah', 'so' are usually unnoticed
  - when practising, get someone to ring a bell to prompt you

 - Using reveal.js with up/down/left/right transitions can be distracting
  - transitions should be consistent
  - deeper slides work if they are diving deeper into the subtopic

 - Eat your own dogfood
  - make sure if you're giving advise as part of your talk, you take your own advise yourself
  - e.g. grammar suggestions, ensure your slides are grammatically perfect
