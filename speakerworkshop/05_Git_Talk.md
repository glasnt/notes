## Talk - Git

 * commit early, commit often
 * remove early
 * branch before you need to

### Feedback

 - In Keynote, `x` button flips the speaker notes and the presentation screens around 

 - Very good story telling (story before and after git, then a technical review of the processes git has)
 
 - good vocal modulation
 
 - Font should be 60pt minimum (fifth of screen height)
 
 - leave 10% space blank on edges of the slide, use negative space

 - using a female heroine is good. male heroes are clichÃ©

 - story had happy, sad and super-sad faces, but no differentiation between sad and supersad
  - ensure your slides match your story

 - lower pitch = better received
  - contralto, not soprano
  - drop the head -> less stretch in vocal chords -> naturally lower voice

 - Flashback slides -> 90% grey

 - gestures should be energetic but not eclectic

 - use a credits slide, but don't talk about it. Useful for photos etc
