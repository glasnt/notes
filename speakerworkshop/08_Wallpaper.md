## Talk - Wallpaper

 * TLDR

### Feedback

 - Model responses from crowd
  - if you want hands raised, raise yours
  - if you want answers, ask a question with the hand raised

 - Free upper arms - you aren't a robot

 - Red highlighting on black background is the worst
  - red guns on projectors burn out fastest
  - white on black, plus bolding or dropshadow, or duplicate text and place just to the side
  - if monospace, preserve the monospace

 - code comments should be in italics as well as a different colour

 - Cat pictures are cheating
