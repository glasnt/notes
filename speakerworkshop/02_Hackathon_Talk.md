## Talk - How to Win at Hackathons

 * The hack is irrelevant
 * three trophies from prior hacks - speaker knows how to win
 * It's all about the sell
 
 * Plan
  - who are the judges? Audience?
  - what's the ideal demo? work backwards. 
 
 * Build
  - minimum viable product
  - don't bother with OAuth, Logins - these aren't interesting, and are solved problems. Fake it!
  - have a designer
  - have a presenter that just focuses on the pitch
  - stop early! the worst thing is to have something break last minute
 
 * Practice the Demo!
  - stop and hour early
  - practice the pitch
  - engage with the audience  

 * SHARP
  - S = Stories
  - H = Humour
  - A = Analogy
  - R = References
  - P = Pictures (with permission, CC licences, etc)

 * The demo
  - your hack is a special snowflake
  - don't just read your slides
  - don't rely on the internet working
   - use a recording if you can
   - fake the bits you don't need
  - when showing the code, think temporal vs spacial
  - disable notifications!
  - don't say 'um', 'so'; pause instead
  - the audience doesn't know your plan!
  - questions don't have to have answers - you only had a day to do things!


### Feedback 
 
 * looked relaxed. knew the material, talked only about 10% of it
 * isolation - speak to the audience

 * self deprecation isn't a positive
 * negative comments about any group is bad

 * Audience don't know your plan 
 - "Oh no" gives the game away


 * Posture
 - holding hands together -> self calming
 - face palms towards the audience

 * Hiding behind a laptop -> barrier to the audience

 * Pysch tip: 
  - lying -> eyes go to the right
  - truth -> eyes go to the left
  --> have laptop on the left
  ( audience reaction to application of advice is unresearched)

 * Dress
  - writing on your shirt is bad (regardless of gender)
  - dark colours, short sleeves -> emphasis on arms, face and hands
  - don't do anything that's distracting, but go for comfort over style
  - wearing a dress can send the wrong message (also, hard for mic attachment)
  - main aim is to be comfortable, but to have your message speak for you
  - practice in a suit if a suit is the assumed dress code (nothing worse than a geek in a suit)

 * Example on non-distracting dress - Steve Jobs
  - black turtle neck, jeans. No change, no distraction. Audience focuses on the message, not the messenger. 

 * Counter example on dress - Marrisa Meyer, Yahoo! CEO
  - dress is distracting, heels may inhibit movement. 
  - but she's allowed to be what she feels comfortable in

 * Personal reveal is good - humanizing

 * Inclusion of a counter intuitive slide good
  - breaks out of expectations
  - "cinema" experience. 

 * Slide deck - lighting and colours and contrast
  - dark text, light background - standard slide
  - dark background, light text - for emphasis
  * black background can be "emotionally exhausting"
 
 * Don't read from the screen
 * Phase in complicated slides
 * The gimmick (Mad Men, winning, 50's theme) worked
 * Pictures should be the full screen
 * Clip art is bad
 * one slide per pictures
 
 * Pointing with one finger -> aggressive. 
  - point with the whole hand (Disney method)
  - counter - counting is ok, but use alternatives (pointing to a finger on the other hand, German counting)
 
 * International gestures = a minefield 
  - so many meanings with even simple gestures
  
 * The 'secret' that's shared (SHARP) is a good ploy
  - draw in
  - also, emphasis on 'big tips'

 * Photocredits - small is OK
 - credits a the end 
 - on the same page can be distracting

 * Slides will distract
 - a heading on a full screen picture, unless it's a puzzle/reveal

 * Learn specific phrases by heart
  - reading big points loses confidence in presenter

 * repeated presentations can be robotic
  - always improve your slides 
  - self assessment after presentation
  - put self in audience's position - they haven't seen the talk before

 * Humour doesn't always stick
  - move on, don't self deprecate on failure

 * Talk for the audience
  - what's their background, culture, technical?

 * In extreme situations, if it is all falling apart - full stop
  - ask what the audience want instead

 * In long talks, 3h+, account for intermission, bathroom breaks.
