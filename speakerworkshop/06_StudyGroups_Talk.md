## Talk - Study Groups

 - Coursera, edX - MOOCs
 
 - Knowing someone else -> increased completion rates because accountability

 - Dropouts are expected

 - Expectations of participants vary

### Feedback
 
 - Not having slides decreases accessibility
  - people that are hard of hearing
  - mentioning resources or weird to spell things -> text good

 - Want to know more? 
  - include external resources on the slides
  - get people to contact you
 
 - Slide line spacing - don't use double spacing

 - Starting with a question
  - audience interaction

 - Learn the speech, don't read it
  - it's hard to make reading from slides seem natural
  - it's more interesting to listening to talking than hearing someone read

 - Use smooth hand gestures
  - jerky sends the wrong energy

 - Breathing!

 - When practising, video over a mirror
  - mirror provides active feedback, where as video is passive

 - Don't be aware you are presenting
  - relaxed, flow

 - Text dropshadow - 1px 50% grey 
  - a subtle pop, like makeup

 - The best jokes are the ones you don't make

 - Eye contact
  - not too short, not too long
  - don't make patterns, they are noticeable

 - "Loads" is aussie slang, not a thing internationally

 - Feet to audience
  - subliminal feet towards what we are interested in

 - Tiny inconsistencies are noticed in a near perfect slidedeck

 - Punctuation precision
  - `...word`
  - `ab-cd`
 
 - Don't directly say the words on your slides in your speech, reword them
