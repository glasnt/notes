## Talk - Game Development

 * Don't refactor your tests and your code at the same time

 * Apache Cordova - cross platform JS -> all devices and mobile operating systems
  - `cordova create` -> www/{index.html,css/,img/,js/}
  - use web browser developer tools

 * Deploying to Chrome
  - `cordova platform add android`
  - `cordova build android`
  - `cordova run android --target xyz`

 * Chrome itself can't fully emulate mobile though
 
 * link phone and laptop, `chrome://inpsect` allows for debugging the phone from the laptop

 * Learn
 * Scope
 * Deadline
 * Accountability 
 * _Start_!

### Feedback
  
 - VGA connector - connect to laptop last - it can spark
  - digital to analog conversion, earth/grounding, etc

 - Laptop resolution will always be better than projector resolution
  - aim for 1024x768 resolution
  - some projectors still have 800x600
  - always aim for 4x3, lowest common denominator

 - Audience Queues
  - console based code will always be assumed to be on a black background
  - called "intentionality"

 - New themes shouldn't be unemotional
 
 - Slides must match the emotion of the speaker at that point

 - Story telling is good

 - people, especially techies, are easily distractable
 
 - if possible, rearrange the room to your advantage
  - clock next to projector = disaster. Move it behind the audience
  - lectern to the left, where possible

 - LotR theme used in talk was a good theme
  - heroine's journey
  - doesn't have to directly link, but can provide a structure

 - You are the post powerful person in the room. Do what you like, as long as it's good.
 
 - Distracting tshirts with lots of writing are distracting

 - You are allowed to smile
  - temptation to be taken seriously by being serious

 - Vocal variation is good - record and review

 - There is nothing wrong with showing emotion
  - communication happens at a emotional and intellectual level
  - removing emotion cuts off communication

 - Refresh icons should be clockwise
  - otherwise, assumption is of rewinding time
  
 - Style is the things you see to see the things you don't see
