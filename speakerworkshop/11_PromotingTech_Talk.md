## Talk - Promoting Tech

 - dilbert slides - need to have silence to allow audience to read it

 - teach people who to fish

 - when promoting, show the business benefits, not the tech
  - they need to get tangible benefits

 - Steps could be used to promote IT team internally


### Feedback

 - clicker worked well

 - tailor the deck to the audience
  - don't have slides that are to be ignored

 - eggplant colour is bad, reminder of a liver

 - consistency through the deck is important
 
 - don't left justify on two different margins

 - go for symmetry on the slides

 - rainbow and a pot of gold has too many alternative analogies
  - could be leprechauns
  - could be LGBTIQ

 - bathroom check before the talk 
  - check appearance
  - fly check

 - Dont touch your face
 
 - Emphasis on colour 
  - if having emphasis, ensure colours aren't accidentally inverted

 - if showing a terrible -> beautiful transition, use a fade

 - spend more time on slides

 - write down suggestions for next time
