## Talk - Continuous Delivery
 
 * Signpost as a story early

 * Enemies 
  - when? early!
  - what? risks
  - where? faux production

 * Scoping, automation

 * Bugs need detailed information 

 * Panic stations - bug prioritization

 * Coverage
  - a high percentage isn't always a good indicator
  - near 100% just means the code path has been traversed at least once

 * Notify when deploying to production
  - sales must know
  - support must know
  - customers should know

 * Testing triangle
  - Base - unit testing
  - Middle - integration testing
  - Tip - browser testing

### Feedback

 - Non native language talk is harder

 - do not emphasise body parts (female anatomy especially)

 - one point -> one or more slides

 - you don't have to introduce points being made (e.g. by reading the slide heading)

 - No sub bullets

 - Don't talk to the screen

 - Diagrams need to match the intention
  - e.g. describing a cycle when the image is a flow

 - Open fingers aren't as strong as closed ones

 - Don't trust manual text wrapping

 - Choose symmetry
  - left or centre justification, but not right

 - Design for crap
  - projectors will be awful
  - usually 256 colours, as opposed to 16 million on a laptop
  - test resolution changes by screenshot and resizing manually

 - Avoid offensive analogies
  - life is too short not to offend anyone

 - Don't default to male pronouns. Female or genderless 
  - "They" is totally acceptable, dates back to 16th century
  - unconscious bias
  - names for groups of people can be offensive - "mate", "ladies", "guys"

 - Separate "Questions?" and "Thanks!" slides
